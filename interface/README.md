# Pos Pool Interface

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Pre-requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.18.1 (higher version may not work)

## Setup

First we need to install the project dependencies.

```sh
$ cd interface
$ yarn # install the npm packages
```

Second a config file `pool.config.js` is need to create

```sh
$ cp pool.config.sample.js pool.config.js
```

The config.sample file's content is like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  defaultLang: 'en',
  testnet: {
    poolManagerAddress: 'cfxtest:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    RPC: 'https://test.confluxrpc.com',
    networkId: 1
  },
  mainnet: {
    poolManagerAddress: 'cfx:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    RPC: 'https://main.confluxrpc.com',
    networkId: 1029
  }
}
```

**Note: The `poolManagerAddress` need to replace with your deployed PoolManagerContract address.**

The dev mode (yarn start) will use the `testnet` config

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### add i18n text

First, add a folder named target language key to the interface/public/locales folder.
copy the translation.json file from the locales/en folder.

Then change the value in the copied translation.json file to the translation of the target language.

Next, import the new language file in locales/index.js and add it to the resources field.
(You can change the default language by modifying the lng field.)

Finally, in Interface/src/pages/components/Header/index.js, add an Option corresponding to the language key under Language Select.
